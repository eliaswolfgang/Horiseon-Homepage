# Horiseon-Homepage

## Description
This site is a mock-up for a digital marketing company's homepage, created using a simple design intended to highlight the company's services and the benefits of using them.

The code for this site was refactored to improve accessibility and functionality in the following ways:
1. All major HTML elements are semantic.
1. All links are internally functional and include titles.
1. All images are properly linked and include alternate descriptions.

## Preview
Because this site is currently not responsive, it is best viewed on a standard, 13-inch desktop window.
