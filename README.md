# Horiseon-Homepage

## Description
This site is a mock-up for a digital marketing company's homepage, created using a simple design intended to highlight the company's services and the benefits of using them.

The code for this site was refactored to improve accessibility and functionality by ensuring the following:
1. All major HTML elements are semantic.
1. All links are internally functional and include titles.
1. All images are properly linked and include alternate descriptions.

The site was tested for accesibility returning 0 errors at: https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://eliaswolfgang.github.io/Horiseon-Homepage/

This site is hosted by GitHub Pages and deployed at https://eliaswolfgang.github.io/Horiseon-Homepage/

## Preview
Because this site is currently not responsive, it is best viewed on a standard, 13-inch desktop window.
